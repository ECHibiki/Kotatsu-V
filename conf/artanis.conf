## to understand these items.


## Whether to use a database, if disabled, the database won't be initialized
## in the beginning, which saves memory and boot time.
## Some users may want to use GNU Artanis without configuring any databases, if
## that's your case please set it to `false' to avoid unintended errors.
## db.enable = <boolean>
db.enable = true

## What database server should be used, depends on the database installed
## on your machine.
## NOTE: If you use MariaDB then you should set it to mysql.
## db.dbd = mysql | postgresql | sqlite3
db.dbd = sqlite3

## The protocol for connecting the databse. If you use tcp, a socket port
## must be specified in the address. And if you choose socketfile, then you should
## specify the unix socket file managed by database server.
## db.proto = tcp | socketfile
db.proto = tcp

## The address of the database server.
## For example, MariaDB by default uses localhost:3306.
## db.addr = <string>
db.addr = 127.0.0.1:5432

## If you configured the database server to connect to a unix socket file,
## then you should fill this field with the file name.
## db.socketfile = <string>
db.socketfile = false

## User name to connect to the database server.
## db.username = <string>
db.username = 

## Password of the user to connect to the database server.
## db.passwd = <string>
db.passwd = 

## The database name.
## db.name = <string>
db.name = db/shitaba

## The engine of the database server.
## NOTE: for sqlite3, you must leave this field blank, as `db.engine = '
## If you remove this item, the default value InnoDB will be used.
## db.engine = <string>
db.engine = 

## The size of DB connection pool. If the specified size is less then required,
## then the task will be scheduled and sleep till there's available DB connection.
## db.poolsize = <integer>
db.poolsize = 16

## The management mode of DB connection pool:
## `increase' for increasing the pool size if any necessary, however it won't reduce back.
## `fixed' will not increase the pool size, if it lacks of DB connections, then it will
## be scheduled.
## db.pool = increase | fixed
db.pool = fixed

## Whether to encode params automatically.
## NOTE: If you enable db.encodeparams then it's better to decode the related value
## twice in the client-side, since some requests may be sent from browsers, and
## they're already encoded.
## db.encodeparams = <boolean>
db.encodeparams = false

## Enable LPC (Lightweight Persistent Cache), this may require Redis.
## db.lpc = <boolean>
db.lpc = false

## Specify your own server info. It'll be Artanis-x.x.x by default, adding
## the artanis version number.
## server.info = <string>
server.info = Artanis-0.4.1

## If you want to use Nginx for reversed-proxy, please enable it.
## server.nginx = enable | disable
server.nginx = false

## Charset in server side. utf-8 in default.
## NOTE: Don't change it unless you know what you're doing!
## server.charset = <string>
server.charset = utf-8

## The path of status page. You may customize your own status pages.
## If you're using application folder from `art create', then you may add your
## customized status pages in sys/pages, for example, if you create 404.html in
## sys/pages, then it will overload the original 404 page.
## server.syspage.path = <string>
server.syspage.path = sys/pages

## Backlog of the socket.
## NOTE: Don't change it unless you really know what you're doing!
## server.backlog = <integer>
server.backlog = 128

## The length of the work queue in Artanis server.
## server.wqlen = <integer>
server.wqlen = 64

## The trigger mode of epoll. Please read epoll man page to know more.
## server.trigger = edge | level
server.trigger = edge

## The server core which is used for holding high concurrent connections.
## Artanis has a strong server core named Ragnarok, which is based on
## delimited-continuations to provide asynchronous non-blocking high concurrent serving.
## You may choose guile inner server which is weak, but useful when you are running
## Artanis on an operating system lacking key features to run Raganrok. For example,
## in GNU/Hurd, which has no epoll.
## You may choose fibers server implemented with threads and delimited continuations,
## which is preemptable by the timer you set.
## For more details please see https://github.com/wingo/fibers/wiki/Manual.
## server.engine = ragnarok | guile | fibers | <customized engine>
server.engine = ragnarok

## Timeout for any connection to Artanis (in seconds).
## 0 for always short live connections.
## server.timeout = <integer>
server.timeout = 60

## The the timeout for each event polling round, in miliseconds.
## server.polltimeout = <integer>
server.polltimeout = 500

## The buffer size (in bytes) of the connecting socket.
## In Ragnarok server core, the request handling will be scheduled when the socket
## buffer is full. This item affects the performance of socket I/O largely.
## Usually, if you're handling a large amount of small requests, it's better to set
## the buffer size to a small value.
## But if you're providing some kind of downloading or uploading service, it's better
## to set it to a larger one.
## A large buffer size will increase the latency of unserved requests.
## Please read the `Ragnarok server core' chapter to learn the design principle,
## if you need to do some tweaking.
## server.bufsize = <integer>
server.bufsize = 12288

## This is the most significant feature of Ragnarok server core.
## Please remember that there're no threads in GNU Artanis.
## All the tasks are based on delimited continuations, this kind of design is the
## so-called Green Threads, or modern terminology, Co-routines.
## GNU/Linux has introduced a feature named SO_REUSEPORT since 3.9.
## This feature let us start multiple Artanis instances listening to the same socket
## port. When requests come, the Linux kernel will do the necessary lock and allocation
## work for us to dispatch requests to these Artanis instances.
## server.multi = <boolean>
server.multi = true

## Enable WebSocket.
## server.websocket = <boolean>
server.websocket = false

## The path to public directory, this is useful for public static resources,
## for exaample, css/img/js, etc.
## server.pub = <string>
server.pub = pub

## Whether to use Linux specified sendfile interface.
## server.sendfile = <boolean>
server.sendfile = true

## The maximum payload size of WebSocket request in bytes. If it exceeds, then it
## will be segemented.
## websocket.maxpayload = <integer>
websocket.maxpayload = 18446744073709551615

## The minimum payload size of WebSocket request in bytes.
## Enlarge it to avoid slow 1-byte attack (only for fragment).
## websocket.minpayload = <integer>
websocket.minpayload = 1

## If fragment >= 0, then it's the size of the websocket frame fragment.
## If fragment = 0, then the websocket frame will not be fragmented.
## websocket.fragment = <integer>
websocket.fragment = 4096

## Maximum upload size in bytes from WebSocket request, the exceeded request
## will be fobidden.
## websocket.maxsize = <integer>
websocket.maxsize = 1024

## Timeout of WebSocket request, in seconds.
## websocket.timeout = <integer>
websocket.timeout = 64

## If disabled, you will have to use the IP address to connect instead of the
## hostname. e.g. `host.addr = 127.0.0.1'.
## host.name = enable | disable | <boolean>
host.name = disable

## The URL/IP of your hosting site.
## host.addr = <URL> | <IP>
#host.addr = 127.0.0.1
host.addr = 127.0.0.1

## The listening port of your hosting site.
## host.port = <integer>
#host.port = 3000
host.port = 3000

## Specify the protocol family.
## host.family = ipv4 | ipv6
host.family = ipv4

## Specify the session files path. Change according to your session engine.
## session.path = <PATH>
session.path = session

## Specify session engine. Here're supported backends:
## simple: uses hash table for memcache.
## db: uses RDBMS for storing sessions.
## file: stores session information into text files.
## redis: uses Redis for managing sessions.
## session.engine = simple | db | file | redis | redis@addr:port | <third-party-engine>
session.backend = simple

## Specify allowed upload file type, say, upload.types = jpg,png,gif.
## upload.types = <item-list>
upload.types = jpg,png,gif

## The path to put the uploaded files.
## upload.path = <PATH>
upload.path = upload

## The size limitation of uploaded file in bytes.
## upload.size = <interger>
upload.size = 12582912

## The maximum age of a cached page in seconds.
## This is the global maxage of any cache.
## If you want to specify maxage for certain page, please read the manual about the Cache.
## cache.maxage = <integer>
cache.maxage = 3600

## Wheather to enable debug mode.
## If you enable debug mode, Artanis will print debug information verbosely.
## The module you modified will be reloaded instantly, and the page view will be rendered as well.
## NOTE: This option will affect the performance, please use it for debug purposes only./
## debug.enable = <boolean>
debug.enable = false

## The paths that needs to be monitored in debug-mode.
## This will take advantage of `inotify' in GNU/Linux kernel.
## NOTE: We may support GNU/Hurd as well, with its file monitor mechanism, in the future.
## debug.monitor = <PATHs>
debug.monitor =
